# Summary

# Major Suggestions

# Minor Suggestions

# Figures

Figures are important and are often central elements used in presenting findings to broad audiences, so I take them seriously and often provide specific suggestions to improve them in reviews I write. These are purely suggestions, and it is difficult to know whether they will actually result in an improved figure without seeing the revised figure...sometimes it takes several iterations.
